Cell: a single element of a Chunk.
Type: type of elements. Type in memory and semiring operations.
Format: how chunk cells are stored in memory.
Partition: surjective function from a Cell to the <Node, Chunk> that contains it.
Chunk: rectangular part of a matrix. Chunk type is the type of its elements, it is identified with a string.
Message: a class instance to be sent to nodes.
Node: a node receives messages, might contains chunks, might do computations, it is identified with a string.
Matrix: a set of Chunk(s) of the same type, the union of the chunks must be a rectangle. The type of a matrix is the type of its chunks.
Shape: peculiar shapes of matrices.


E.g.,

A
--------------
I N.a        I
I            I
--------------
I     I      I
I N.b I M.a  I
I     I      I
I     I      I
--------------

We have one matrix (A), two nodes (N and M), three chunks (N.a, N.b and M.a).
Two chunks are in the Node N, one chunk is in the node M.
